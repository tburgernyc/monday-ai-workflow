# GitHub MCP Server Setup

This document outlines the setup process for the GitHub MCP server integration with the monday-ai-workflow project.

## Overview

The GitHub MCP (Model Context Protocol) server allows direct interaction with GitHub repositories through AI tools. This integration enables automated repository management, code search, issue tracking, and more directly from the AI interface.

## Setup Details

The GitHub MCP server was set up with the following configuration:

1. Server name: `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github`
2. Installation method: NPX package `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github`
3. Configuration location: `/home/codespace/.vscode-remote/data/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
4. Directory created: `/home/codespace/Documents/Cline/MCP/github`

## Available Tools

The GitHub MCP server provides numerous tools for GitHub interaction, including:

- Repository creation and management
- File operations (create, read, update)
- Issue and pull request management
- Code and repository search
- Branch management
- Commit operations

## Usage Examples

### Searching Repositories

```javascript
// Example of using the search_repositories tool
{
  "query": "MCP server"
}
```

### Creating or Updating Files

```javascript
// Example of using the create_or_update_file tool
{
  "owner": "username",
  "repo": "repository-name",
  "path": "path/to/file.txt",
  "content": "File content goes here",
  "message": "Commit message",
  "branch": "main"
}
```

## Benefits for monday-ai-workflow

This integration enhances the project by:

1. Enabling automated code updates and repository management
2. Facilitating easier issue tracking and management
3. Providing powerful search capabilities across the codebase
4. Streamlining the development workflow through AI-assisted GitHub operations

## Security Considerations

The GitHub MCP server uses a Personal Access Token for authentication. This token should be kept secure and rotated regularly according to security best practices.
