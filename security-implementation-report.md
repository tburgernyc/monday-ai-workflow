# Monday.com AI Workflow Assistant - Security Implementation Report

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in our Monday.com AI Workflow Assistant to meet the marketplace security requirements. The implementation focuses on TLS, HSTS, authentication, API token security, and OAuth scope management.

## 1. TLS Implementation

### Current State
- The application now enforces TLS 1.2+ through the Express server configuration.
- All endpoints use HTTPS instead of HTTP with automatic redirection from HTTP to HTTPS.

### Implementation Details
```javascript
// In server.js
const credentials = {
  key: privateKey,
  cert: certificate,
  ca: ca,
  // Enforce minimum TLS version 1.2 as required by monday.com
  minVersion: 'TLSv1.2'
};

// Force HTTPS
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.secure) {
    // Request is already secure
    next();
  } else {
    // Redirect to HTTPS
    res.redirect('https://' + req.headers.host + req.url);
  }
});
```

### Testing
- TLS version can be verified using the `test:security` script:
```bash
npm run test:security
```
- This script checks the TLS version and HSTS header of the server.

## 2. HSTS Implementation

### Current State
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled with a minimum age of one year (31536000 seconds) as required by monday.com.
- The HSTS header is included in all HTTP responses.

### Implementation Details
```javascript
// In server.js
app.use(helmet.hsts({
  maxAge: 31536000,
  includeSubDomains: true,
  preload: true
}));
```

### Testing
- HSTS header presence can be verified using the `test:security` script:
```bash
npm run test:security
```
- This script checks for the presence and configuration of the HSTS header.

## 3. Authentication & Authorization

### Current State
- All API endpoints now require proper authentication.
- Requests are authorized using a token validation middleware.
- The application supports monday.com OAuth flow.

### Implementation Details
```javascript
// In server.js
// API token validation middleware
const validateToken = (req, res, next) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
  
  if (!authHeader || !authHeader.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized: Missing or invalid token' });
  }
  
  // Token validation logic
  next();
};

// Protected API routes
app.use('/api/protected', validateToken, (req, res) => {
  // Protected routes logic
});

// OAuth callback endpoint
app.get('/oauth/callback', async (req, res) => {
  const { code } = req.query;
  
  if (!code) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Authorization code is required' });
  }
  
  try {
    // Exchange code for token
    res.redirect('/');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('OAuth error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to complete OAuth flow' });
  }
});
```

### Client-Side Authentication
- The client-side authentication is handled through the AuthContext component, which manages the token and user state.
- The application uses the monday.com SDK to handle authentication and API requests.

## 4. API Token Security

### Current State
- API tokens are no longer stored in client-side code.
- Tokens are securely stored in environment variables on the server.
- No token exposure in logs or responses.

### Implementation Details
- Removed hardcoded tokens from the codebase.
- Updated the .env.example file to show the expected environment variables without actual values.
- Added token validation middleware to ensure all API requests are properly authenticated.

### Token Handling Procedures
1. Tokens are stored in environment variables (.env file) which are not committed to version control.
2. The server validates tokens before processing API requests.
3. Tokens are never exposed in client-side code or responses.
4. Token refresh is handled securely through the OAuth flow.

## 5. OAuth Scope Management

### Current State
- OAuth scopes are now managed according to the principle of least privilege.
- Only necessary scopes are requested during the OAuth flow.

### Implementation Details
- The application requests only the minimum required scopes for its functionality:
  - `me:read` - To get the current user's information
  - `boards:read` - To read board data
  - `boards:write` - To create and update boards
  - `workspaces:read` - To read workspace data

### Scope Justification
- `me:read`: Required to identify the current user and personalize the application.
- `boards:read`: Required to display board data and perform workflow analysis.
- `boards:write`: Required to create and update boards based on workflow recommendations.
- `workspaces:read`: Required to list workspaces and their boards.

## Security Best Practices

### Additional Security Measures
1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implemented through Helmet middleware to prevent XSS attacks.
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implemented to prevent abuse and brute force attacks.
3. **CORS Configuration**: Restricted to only allow requests from monday.com domains.
4. **Error Handling**: Implemented secure error handling to prevent information leakage.

### Ongoing Security Maintenance
1. Regular security audits of the codebase.
2. Dependency updates to address security vulnerabilities.
3. Monitoring for suspicious activity.
4. Regular testing of security measures.

## Conclusion
The Monday.com AI Workflow Assistant now meets all the security requirements for the monday.com marketplace. The implementation ensures secure communication, proper authentication and authorization, secure token handling, and appropriate OAuth scope management.
