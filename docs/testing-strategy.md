# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for the monday.com AI Workflow Assistant app. The testing strategy ensures code quality, reliability, and maintainability through a comprehensive suite of tests.

## Testing Levels

### Unit Tests

Unit tests verify that individual components, hooks, and services work correctly in isolation. These tests focus on:

- Component rendering and behavior
- Hook logic and state management
- Service method functionality
- Edge cases and error handling

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different parts of the system work together correctly. These tests focus on:

- Component interactions
- Service integrations
- End-to-end workflows
- Data flow between components

### Performance Tests

Performance tests measure and optimize the application's performance. These tests focus on:

- Component rendering performance
- Data fetching and caching efficiency
- Resource utilization
- Response times

## Test Organization

Tests are organized in a structure that mirrors the source code:

- `src/__tests__/components/` - Tests for React components
- `src/__tests__/hooks/` - Tests for custom React hooks
- `src/__tests__/services/` - Tests for service modules
- `src/__tests__/subscription/` - Tests for subscription-related functionality
- `src/tests/performance/` - Performance-specific tests
- `src/tests/accessibility/` - Accessibility compliance tests

## Testing Tools and Libraries

- **Jest**: Primary testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
- **Mock Service Worker**: For mocking API requests
- **Jest Mocks**: For isolating components from dependencies
- **Performance Testing Tools**: For measuring and optimizing performance

## Mocking Strategy

The testing approach uses mocks to isolate components and services:

1. **Service Mocks**: External services are mocked to provide controlled test environments
2. **API Mocks**: API calls are mocked to avoid external dependencies
3. **Component Mocks**: Complex child components may be mocked to focus tests on the component under test
4. **Context Mocks**: React contexts are mocked to provide controlled state

## Test Naming Conventions

Tests follow a consistent naming convention:

- Unit tests: `ComponentName.test.tsx` or `hookName.test.tsx`
- Integration tests: `feature.integration.test.tsx`
- Performance tests: `Component.performance.test.tsx`
- Accessibility tests: `Component.accessibility.test.tsx`
- Visual tests: `Component.visual.test.tsx`

## Test Coverage Goals

The testing strategy aims for high coverage of critical code paths:

- **Core Components**: 90%+ coverage
- **Business Logic**: 85%+ coverage
- **Utility Functions**: 80%+ coverage
- **UI Components**: 75%+ coverage

## Continuous Integration

Tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

1. All tests run on pull requests
2. Unit tests run on every commit
3. Integration tests run before deployment
4. Performance tests run on scheduled intervals

## Test-Driven Development

For critical features and bug fixes, a test-driven development approach is encouraged:

1. Write failing tests that define the expected behavior
2. Implement the minimum code to make tests pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Tests should be independent and not rely on other tests
2. **Readability**: Tests should be easy to understand and maintain
3. **Speed**: Tests should run quickly to provide fast feedback
4. **Reliability**: Tests should produce consistent results
5. **Maintainability**: Tests should be easy to update when requirements change

## Future Improvements

1. Expand test coverage for recently added components
2. Implement more comprehensive integration tests
3. Add more performance benchmarks
4. Enhance accessibility testing
