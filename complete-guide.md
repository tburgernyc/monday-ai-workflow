## Getting Started

### What You Need

- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- A [monday.com](https://monday.com) developer account
- An [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) account (for Claude AI integration)
- Basic knowledge of React, TypeScript, and GraphQL

### Required API Keys

You'll need to obtain these API keys:

1. **monday.com API Key**: Generate this in your monday.com account under Developer Settings.
2. **monday.com App Client ID**: Created when you register a new app in the monday.com Developer Center.
3. **Claude API Key**: Obtain this from OpenRouter (sign up at openrouter.ai).

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name it "monday-ai-workflow-assistant"
5. Add a description: "AI-powered workflow assistant for monday.com"
6. Choose Public or Private (your preference)
7. Check "Add a README file"
8. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Set Up GitHub Codespaces

1. Navigate to your new repository
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Select the "Codespaces" tab
4. Click "Create codespace on main"
5. Wait for your codespace to initialize

### Step 3: Create Directory Structure

1. Open a terminal in your Codespace
2. Run the following commands to create the necessary directory structure:

```bash
# Create main project directories
mkdir -p src/assets/styles
mkdir -p src/components/Authentication
mkdir -p src/components/Layout
mkdir -p src/components/Dashboard
mkdir -p src/components/WorkspaceManagement
mkdir -p src/components/BoardManagement
mkdir -p src/components/WorkflowAnalysis
mkdir -p src/services/api
mkdir -p src/services/analysis
mkdir -p src/services/nlp
mkdir -p src/utils
mkdir -p src/hooks
mkdir -p src/constants
mkdir -p src/context
mkdir -p prompts
mkdir -p public

# Create empty files to commit directory structure
touch src/assets/styles/.gitkeep
touch src/components/Authentication/.gitkeep
touch src/components/Layout/.gitkeep
touch src/components/Dashboard/.gitkeep
touch src/components/WorkspaceManagement/.gitkeep
touch src/components/BoardManagement/.gitkeep
touch src/components/WorkflowAnalysis/.gitkeep
touch src/services/api/.gitkeep
touch src/services/analysis/.gitkeep
touch src/services/nlp/.gitkeep
touch src/utils/.gitkeep
touch src/hooks/.gitkeep
touch src/constants/.gitkeep
touch src/context/.gitkeep
touch prompts/.gitkeep

# Commit the directory structure
git add .
git commit -m "Create initial directory structure"
git push
```

### Step 4: Create Configuration Files

Now you need to create several important configuration files. First, create `package.json`:

1. In your Codespace, open the Explorer view
2. Right-click on the root folder and select "New File"
3. Name it "package.json"
4. Copy and paste the content from the package.json artifact

Next, create `tsconfig.json`:

1. Right-click on the root folder and select "New File"
2. Name it "tsconfig.json"
3. Copy and paste the content from the tsconfig.json artifact

Create `.env.example`:

1. Right-click on the root folder and select "New File"
2. Name it ".env.example"
3. Copy and paste the content from the .env.example artifact

Create your actual `.env` file:

1. Right-click on the root folder and select "New File"
2. Name it ".env"
3. Copy the content from ".env.example" and fill in your actual API keys

### Step 5: Install Dependencies

Run the following commands to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
# Install dependencies from package.json
npm install

# Install monday apps CLI globally
npm install -g @mondaycom/apps-cli

# Verify installation
mapps help
```

## Understanding the Code Structure

Our app follows a well-organized structure:

- **src/services/api/**: Contains services for interacting with monday.com API
- **src/services/analysis/**: Contains services for analyzing workflow data
- **src/services/nlp/**: Contains services for natural language processing and AI
- **src/components/**: Contains all React components organized by feature
- **src/utils/**: Contains utility functions
- **src/assets/**: Contains styles and other static assets
- **prompts/**: Contains development prompt files for each phase

### Core Service Files

Copy the content from the following artifacts to create these service files:

1. **src/services/api/mondayApi.ts**: Base monday.com SDK integration
2. **src/utils/graphqlClient.ts**: GraphQL client for API communication
3. **src/services/api/workspaceService.ts**: Workspace management
4. **src/services/api/boardService.ts**: Board and item management
5. **src/services/nlp/claudeService.ts**: Claude AI integration
6. **src/services/analysis/workflowAnalysis.ts**: Workflow analysis logic

### Core Component Files

Copy the content from the following artifacts to create these component files:

1. **src/components/Authentication/AuthContext.tsx**: Authentication context
2. **src/components/Authentication/Login.tsx**: Login component
3. **src/components/App.tsx**: Main application component
4. **src/components/Layout/Layout.tsx**: Layout component
5. **src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx**: Dashboard component

### Styles

1. **src/assets/styles/global.css**: Global styles for the application

## Development Process (Phased Approach)

We'll follow a phased approach to develop the app step by step. In each phase, we'll focus on a specific part of the application.

### Phase 1: Environment Setup

1. Copy the content from `prompts/phase1-setup.md` artifact to the file `prompts/phase1-setup.md`
2. Follow the instructions in this file to set up your development environment
3. Verify that all configurations are working correctly

### Phase 2: Core Services Implementation

1. Copy the content from `prompts/phase2-core-services.md` artifact to the file `prompts/phase2-core-services.md`
2. Follow the instructions to implement the core service layer
3. Test the services to ensure they communicate correctly with monday.com

### Phase 3: AI Integration

1. Copy the content from `prompts/phase3-ai-integration.md` artifact to the file `prompts/phase3-ai-integration.md`
2. Follow the instructions to integrate Claude AI for workflow analysis
3. Test the AI analysis features with sample workflow data

### Phase 4: UI Development

1. Copy the content from `prompts/phase4-ui-components.md` artifact to the file `prompts/phase4-ui-components.md`
2. Follow the instructions to implement all UI components
3. Test the interface to ensure it correctly displays data and responds to user input

### Phase 5: Testing and Deployment

1. Copy the content from `prompts/phase5-testing-deployment.md` artifact to the file `prompts/phase5-testing-deployment.md`
2. Follow the instructions to add tests, optimize performance, and prepare for deployment
3. Deploy the application to monday.com

## Testing Your App

### Local Testing

To test your app locally:

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Expose your local server to the internet using ngrok or the monday apps CLI:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Use monday apps CLI tunnel
   mapps tunnel:create
   
   # Option 2: Use ngrok (install first)
   npx ngrok http 3000
   ```

3. Configure your monday.com app in the Developer Center to use the tunnel URL

### Testing with monday.com

1. In your monday.com account, go to the Developer Center
2. Configure your app with the appropriate URLs
3. Install the app on your account for testing
4. Use the app to analyze workflows and create workspaces

## Deploying to monday.com

When you're ready to deploy your app:

1. Create a production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy using the monday apps CLI:
   ```bash
   mapps code:push
   ```

3. Verify the deployment in the monday.com Developer Center

## Submitting to the Marketplace

To submit your app to the monday.com marketplace:

1. Ensure your app meets all marketplace requirements
2. Create comprehensive documentation
3. Prepare marketing materials (screenshots, videos, etc.)
4. Submit your app for review in the Developer Center

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **API Rate Limiting**: If you hit rate limits, adjust the limiter configuration in `mondayApi.ts`
- **Authentication Errors**: Verify your API tokens and app credentials
- **CORS Issues**: Ensure your app URLs are correctly configured in the Developer Center
- **Build Errors**: Check that all dependencies are correctly installed
