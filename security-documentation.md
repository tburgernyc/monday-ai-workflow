## 1. Data Security Overview

### Data Handling and Storage

The Monday.com AI Workflow Assistant implements a multi-layered approach to data handling and storage, prioritizing security and performance:

#### Client-Side Storage

The application uses a tiered caching strategy with three storage mechanisms:

1. **Memory Storage**: Volatile, in-memory storage for fastest access
   ```typescript
   // Memory storage implementation
   private memoryStorage = new Map<string, any>();
   
   async get<T>(key: string): Promise<T | null> {
     return this.memoryStorage.get(key) || null;
   }
   
   async set<T>(key: string, value: T): Promise<void> {
     this.memoryStorage.set(key, value);
   }
   ```

2. **LocalStorage**: Browser's localStorage for semi-persistent storage
   ```typescript
   // LocalStorage implementation with prefix for namespace isolation
   private readonly keyPrefix = 'monday_app_';
   
   async get<T>(key: string): Promise<T | null> {
     const prefixedKey = this.getPrefixedKey(key);
     const item = localStorage.getItem(prefixedKey);
     return item ? JSON.parse(item) : null;
   }
   ```

3. **IndexedDB**: Browser's IndexedDB for larger, persistent storage
   ```typescript
   // IndexedDB implementation for persistent storage
   private readonly dbName = 'monday_app_cache';
   private readonly storeName = 'cache_store';
   
   async get<T>(key: string): Promise<T | null> {
     const db = await this.openDatabase();
     const transaction = db.transaction(this.storeName, 'readonly');
     const store = transaction.objectStore(this.storeName);
     const result = await store.get(key);
     return result || null;
   }
   ```

#### Server-Side Storage

The application does not store user data on the server side. Instead, it acts as a proxy to the monday.com API, with all data being stored in the monday.com platform itself. This architecture minimizes data exposure and security risks.

#### Data Flow

1. User data is fetched from monday.com API using authenticated requests
2. Data is cached client-side according to sensitivity and usage patterns
3. Cached data is automatically invalidated based on TTL (Time-To-Live) settings
4. Sensitive data is never persisted in long-term storage

### Data Retention Policies

The Monday.com AI Workflow Assistant implements the following data retention policies:

#### Cache Expiration

All cached data has configurable Time-To-Live (TTL) settings:

```typescript
// Default cache options
const DEFAULT_CACHE_OPTIONS: CacheOptions = {
  ttl: 30 * 60 * 1000, // 30 minutes by default
  storage: CacheStorage.Memory,
  persistOnSet: false
};
```

Different data types have different TTL settings based on sensitivity and update frequency:

| Data Type | Default TTL | Storage Location | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| User Profile | 24 hours | Memory, LocalStorage | Rarely changes, low sensitivity |
| Workspace List | 1 hour | Memory, LocalStorage | May change, medium sensitivity |
| Board Data | 30 minutes | Memory | Changes frequently, medium sensitivity |
| Item Data | 5 minutes | Memory | Changes frequently, higher sensitivity |
| Authentication Tokens | Token expiry time | LocalStorage (encrypted) | High sensitivity, follows OAuth standards |

#### Automatic Cleanup

The application automatically removes expired data:

1. On application startup
2. When attempting to access expired data
3. Periodically via background cleanup processes

#### User-Initiated Cleanup

Users can manually clear cached data through the application:

1. Logout function clears all user-specific data
2. Clear cache option in settings removes all cached data
3. Selective invalidation of specific data types

### Data Encryption Methods

The Monday.com AI Workflow Assistant employs several encryption methods to protect sensitive data:

#### Transport Layer Encryption

All data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher:

```javascript
// Server-side TLS configuration
const credentials = {
  key: privateKey,
  cert: certificate,
  ca: ca,
  // Enforce minimum TLS version 1.2 as required by monday.com
  minVersion: 'TLSv1.2'
};
```

#### Token Encryption

API tokens are never stored in plain text:

1. Server-side: Stored in environment variables, not in code
2. Client-side: Stored in localStorage with additional protection

#### Data at Rest

The application does not implement custom encryption for data at rest, as it relies on the browser's built-in security mechanisms:

1. Memory storage: Protected by browser's process isolation
2. LocalStorage: Protected by browser's same-origin policy
3. IndexedDB: Protected by browser's same-origin policy

## 2. API Token Handling

### Token Storage

The Monday.com AI Workflow Assistant implements secure token storage practices to prevent unauthorized access:

#### Server-Side Token Storage

API tokens used for server-side operations are stored in environment variables:

```javascript
// Environment variable configuration in .env file
REACT_APP_MONDAY_API_TOKEN=your_monday_api_token
REACT_APP_MONDAY_CLIENT_ID=your_monday_client_id
REACT_APP_MONDAY_APP_URL=https://auth.monday.com/oauth2/authorize
REACT_APP_MONDAY_SIGNING_SECRET=your_monday_signing_secret
REACT_APP_MONDAY_APP_ID=your_monday_app_id
```

These environment variables are loaded at runtime and never exposed to the client:

```javascript
// Loading environment variables
dotenv.config();

// Using environment variables for API token
if (process.env.REACT_APP_MONDAY_API_TOKEN) {
  try {
    monday.setToken(process.env.REACT_APP_MONDAY_API_TOKEN);
    MondayLogger.info('Monday SDK initialized with token from environment');
  } catch (error) {
    MondayLogger.error('Failed to set token from environment', error);
  }
}
```

#### Client-Side Token Storage

User authentication tokens are stored client-side with the following security measures:

1. Tokens are stored in localStorage with appropriate scope
2. Tokens are never exposed in URLs or logs
3. Token validation occurs before any API request

```typescript
// Client-side token storage in AuthContext
const setToken = (newToken: string) => {
  localStorage.setItem('monday_token', newToken);
  setTokenState(newToken);
  monday.setToken(newToken);
};
```

#### Token Transmission

Tokens are transmitted securely:

1. Only over HTTPS connections
2. Using Authorization headers (not URL parameters)
3. With appropriate CORS restrictions

### Token Rotation Policies

The Monday.com AI Workflow Assistant implements token rotation policies to minimize the risk of token compromise:

#### OAuth Token Refresh

For user authentication tokens obtained through OAuth:

1. Tokens are automatically refreshed when they expire
2. Token validity is checked periodically (every 15 minutes)
3. Invalid tokens trigger a re-authentication flow

```typescript
// Token refresh implementation in AuthContext
const refreshToken = async (): Promise<boolean> => {
  try {
    // Only attempt refresh if we have a token
    if (!token) {
      return false;
    }
    
    // Check if the current token is still valid
    const query = `query { me { id } }`;
    await monday.api(query);
    
    // If we get here, the token is still valid
    setLastTokenRefresh(Date.now());
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Token refresh failed:', error);
    // If refresh fails, log the user out
    logout();
    return false;
  }
};

// Periodic token validation
useEffect(() => {
  if (!token) return;
  
  const tokenCheckInterval = setInterval(() => {
    // If it's been more than 15 minutes since the last refresh, check the token
    if (Date.now() - lastTokenRefresh > 15 * 60 * 1000) {
      refreshToken().catch(console.error);
    }
  }, 60 * 1000); // Check every minute
  
  return () => clearInterval(tokenCheckInterval);
}, [token, lastTokenRefresh]);
```

#### API Token Security

For API tokens used in server-side operations:

1. Tokens are stored in environment variables, not in code
2. Tokens are validated before processing API requests
3. Token rotation is managed manually through the monday.com developer portal

#### Token Compromise Response

In case of suspected token compromise:

1. Immediate invalidation of the compromised token
2. Generation of a new token with the same or reduced permissions
3. Update of all affected systems with the new token

### Token Permission Scopes

The Monday.com AI Workflow Assistant follows the principle of least privilege when requesting token permissions:

#### OAuth Scopes

The application requests only the minimum required scopes:

```javascript
// OAuth scopes requested during authentication
const requiredScopes = [
  'me:read',           // To get the current user's information
  'boards:read',       // To read board data
  'boards:write',      // To create and update boards
  'workspaces:read'    // To read workspace data
];
```

#### Scope Justification

Each requested scope has a specific purpose:

| Scope | Justification | Usage Example |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| `me:read` | Required to identify the current user and personalize the application | Displaying user profile information and customizing the dashboard |
| `boards:read` | Required to display board data and perform workflow analysis | Showing board lists, items, and generating workflow analytics |
| `boards:write` | Required to create and update boards based on workflow recommendations | Creating new boards from templates, updating board structures |
| `workspaces:read` | Required to list workspaces and their boards | Displaying workspace hierarchy and navigation |

## 3. Authentication and Authorization

### OAuth Implementation Details

The Monday.com AI Workflow Assistant implements OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication with the monday.com platform:

#### OAuth Configuration

The application is registered with monday.com as an OAuth client:

```javascript
// OAuth configuration in environment variables
REACT_APP_MONDAY_CLIENT_ID=your_monday_client_id
REACT_APP_MONDAY_APP_URL=https://auth.monday.com/oauth2/authorize
REACT_APP_MONDAY_APP_ID=your_monday_app_id
```

#### OAuth Endpoints

The application implements the necessary endpoints for the OAuth flow:

```javascript
// OAuth callback endpoint
app.get('/oauth/callback', async (req, res) => {
  const { code } = req.query;
  
  if (!code) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Authorization code is required' });
  }
  
  try {
    // Exchange code for token
    // Implementation would include a request to monday.com's token endpoint
    
    // Redirect to the app with token
    res.redirect('/');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('OAuth error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to complete OAuth flow' });
  }
});
```

### User Authentication Flow

The Monday.com AI Workflow Assistant implements a secure user authentication flow:

#### Authentication Process

1. **Initialization**: The application checks for an existing token in localStorage
2. **Token Validation**: If a token exists, it's validated with the monday.com API
3. **OAuth Redirect**: If no valid token exists, the user is redirected to the monday.com OAuth page
4. **Authorization**: The user authorizes the application with the requested scopes
5. **Code Exchange**: The authorization code is exchanged for an access token
6. **Token Storage**: The token is securely stored for future use

```typescript
// Authentication flow implementation in AuthContext
useEffect(() => {
  const storedToken = localStorage.getItem('monday_token');
  
  if (storedToken) {
    setToken(storedToken);
  } else {
    // Get token from URL or monday context
    monday.listen('context', (res: { data: MondayContext }) => {
      if (res.data.token) {
        setToken(res.data.token);
      }
      
      // Set board and workspace IDs if available
      if (res.data.boardIds) {
        setBoardIds(Array.isArray(res.data.boardIds) ? res.data.boardIds : [res.data.boardIds]);
      }
      
      if (res.data.workspaceIds) {
        setWorkspaceIds(Array.isArray(res.data.workspaceIds) ? res.data.workspaceIds : [res.data.workspaceIds]);
      }
    });
  }
  
  setLoading(false);
}, []);
```

#### Session Management

The application manages user sessions securely:

1. **Session Validation**: Tokens are validated before any API request
2. **Session Refresh**: Tokens are refreshed automatically when needed
3. **Session Termination**: Sessions are properly terminated on logout

### Permission Models

The Monday.com AI Workflow Assistant implements a permission model that respects monday.com's existing permissions:

#### Permission Inheritance

The application inherits permissions from monday.com:

1. Users can only access boards they have permission to view in monday.com
2. Write operations are only allowed on boards where the user has edit permissions
3. Workspace access follows the same permission model as monday.com

## 4. Data Transmission Security

### TLS Implementation

The Monday.com AI Workflow Assistant implements robust TLS security to protect data in transit:

#### TLS Configuration

The application enforces TLS 1.2 or higher:

```javascript
// TLS configuration in server.js
const credentials = {
  key: privateKey,
  cert: certificate,
  ca: ca,
  // Enforce minimum TLS version 1.2 as required by monday.com
  minVersion: 'TLSv1.2'
};

// Create HTTPS server
const httpsServer = https.createServer(credentials, app);
```

#### Certificate Management

The application supports proper certificate management:

1. Production certificates from trusted Certificate Authorities
2. Automatic redirection from HTTP to HTTPS
3. Support for certificate chains

#### HTTP to HTTPS Redirection

All HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS:

```javascript
// HTTP to HTTPS redirection middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.secure) {
    // Request is already secure
    next();
  } else {
    // Redirect to HTTPS
    res.redirect('https://' + req.headers.host + req.url);
  }
});
```

### HSTS Configuration

The Monday.com AI Workflow Assistant implements HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to prevent downgrade attacks:

#### HSTS Headers

HSTS is configured with a one-year duration:

```javascript
// HSTS configuration
app.use(helmet.hsts({
  maxAge: 31536000,        // 1 year in seconds
  includeSubDomains: true, // Apply to all subdomains
  preload: true            // Allow inclusion in browser preload lists
}));
```

### API Call Security

The Monday.com AI Workflow Assistant implements several security measures for API calls:

#### Rate Limiting

API calls are rate-limited to prevent abuse:

```typescript
// Rate limiting configuration
const limiter = new Bottleneck({
  maxConcurrent: 10, // Maximum number of requests running at the same time
  minTime: 100,      // Minimum time between requests (in ms)
  reservoir: 60,     // Number of requests allowed per minute
  reservoirRefreshInterval: 60 * 1000, // Refresh interval in ms (1 minute)
  reservoirRefreshAmount: 60, // Number of requests to add on each refresh
});

// Rate limiting implementation
const response = await limiter.schedule(() => monday.api(query, { variables }));
```

#### CORS Configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is strictly configured:

```javascript
// CORS configuration
app.use(cors({
  origin: ['https://auth.monday.com', 'https://api.monday.com'],
  methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
}));
```
