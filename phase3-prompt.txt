# Monday.com AI Workflow Assistant: Phase 3 - AI Integration

## Current Phase: AI and NLP Services

Now let's implement the AI features using Claude 3.7 Sonnet:

1. **Complete Claude Integration Service**:
   - Finish implementing the `claudeService.ts` file
   - Add proper error handling for API failures
   - Implement caching for AI responses to reduce token usage
   - Add retry logic for unstable connections

2. **Enhance Workflow Analysis Module**:
   - Complete the `workflowAnalysis.ts` implementation
   - Add methods to detect workflow bottlenecks
   - Implement metrics calculation for efficiency scoring
   - Create recommendation generation logic

3. **Implement Natural Language Processing**:
   - Add intent recognition for user queries
   - Implement entity extraction from natural language
   - Create response generation for user questions
   - Add context management for multi-turn conversations

4. **Create AI-Powered Workspace Generation**:
   - Implement conversion of text descriptions to workspace structures
   - Add board template suggestions based on user needs
   - Create column and group recommendations
   - Implement validation for generated structures

5. **Test AI Integration**:
   - Test bottleneck detection with sample workflow data
   - Verify workspace generation from text descriptions
   - Test recommendation quality and relevance
   - Ensure error handling for AI service failures

Please follow monday.com's AI guidelines by ensuring:
- User review mechanisms for AI-generated content
- Proper error handling for AI service failures
- Clear documentation of AI capabilities
- Rate limiting to prevent excessive API usage

Implement these services and demonstrate their functionality with real workflow data examples.

## Questions for Review
1. Is the Claude integration robust enough to handle API failures?
2. Are the workflow analysis algorithms detecting bottlenecks accurately?
3. Does the natural language processing correctly understand user intents?
4. Is there any opportunity to optimize token usage to reduce costs?
